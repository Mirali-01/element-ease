An colorful and interactive way to learn about the chemical elements that make up our weird universe.

Learn some wonderful facts about each element and enjoy the cool features that come with the site.

Features Include:

- A color-coordinated key showing the types of elements that exist on earth
- A display to show an enlarged version of each element as you hover over them
- A modal which displays more information on the element that was clicked
- My favorite feature: A spinning React icon!
